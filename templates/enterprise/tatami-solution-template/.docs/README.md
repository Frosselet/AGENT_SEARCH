# Documentation process

The main [README](../README.md) is generated automatically.

Authors of this module shall not edit it directly. They will instead edit its [header](header.md) and [footer](footer.md) portions in the `.docs` folder, and later launch `.docs/gen.sh` from the root of the repository.

The generated README is mainly focused on thr Terraform aspects of this module. If you want to add other elements of information, fill the [header](header.md) and [footer](footer.md) files accordingly.
