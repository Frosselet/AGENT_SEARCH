# 🧪 Prototypes & Experimental Code

**⚠️ WARNING: This directory contains experimental code for concept validation. NOT suitable for production use.**

---

## 🎯 **What This Directory Contains**

This is our **experimentation playground** where we:
- **Simulate new features** to understand requirements before building them
- **Mock behaviors** to test interfaces and user experience
- **Prototype solutions** for complex technical challenges
- **Validate concepts** before investing in full implementation

### **🚨 IMPORTANT: These are NOT production implementations**

The code here is designed to:
- ✅ **Demonstrate concepts** and future possibilities
- ✅ **Test user interfaces** and workflow patterns
- ✅ **Validate technical approaches** before implementation
- ❌ **NOT handle edge cases** or production requirements
- ❌ **NOT include proper error handling** or security
- ❌ **NOT provide stable APIs** (interfaces change frequently)

## ⚠️ **Code Warning Labels**

All prototype code includes these warning markers:

### **🧪 PROTOTYPE - Not Production Ready**
```python
# 🧪 PROTOTYPE WARNING: This is experimental code for concept validation
# ❌ NOT suitable for production use
# ❌ Missing error handling, security, and edge case coverage
# ✅ Demonstrates intended functionality and interface design
```

### **🎭 SIMULATION - Mock Implementation**
```python
# 🎭 SIMULATION WARNING: This code mocks behavior for testing
# ❌ Does not implement real functionality
# ❌ Returns hardcoded responses for demonstration
# ✅ Shows expected inputs, outputs, and user experience
```

### **🔬 EXPERIMENT - Research Code**
```python
# 🔬 EXPERIMENT WARNING: Exploratory research code
# ❌ Unstable and subject to frequent changes
# ❌ May not work in all environments
# ✅ Investigates feasibility of new approaches
```

## 🎯 **How We Use Prototypes**

### **1. Concept Validation**
Before building a new agent, we create a simulation that:
- Shows what the CLI interface would look like
- Demonstrates expected inputs and outputs
- Tests the user experience and workflow

### **2. Technical Feasibility**
We build minimal prototypes to:
- Test integration with external APIs
- Validate performance assumptions
- Explore different implementation approaches

### **3. Interface Design**
We mock up interfaces to:
- Get feedback on command structures
- Test different output formats
- Validate integration patterns

### **4. Requirements Discovery**
Through prototyping we discover:
- Hidden complexity in requirements
- Edge cases that need handling
- Performance and scalability challenges

## 🚀 **From Prototype to Production**

### **Our Development Process:**

1. **🧪 Prototype**: Build simulation in `prototypes/`
2. **📋 Specify**: Document requirements in `docs/roadmap/`
3. **🏗️ Implement**: Build production version in `src/`
4. **📚 Document**: Add to `docs/current/`
5. **🗂️ Archive**: Move prototype to `legacy/`

### **Production Readiness Checklist:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Input validation and security
- ✅ Unit and integration tests
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Documentation and examples
- ✅ Logging and monitoring
- ✅ Configuration management

## 🛠️ **Running Prototype Code**

### **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Prototypes may have additional dependencies
cd prototypes/
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If exists

# Each prototype includes its own README with specific instructions
```

### **Typical Usage Pattern**
```bash
# Most prototypes are run directly
python prototypes/agents/infrastructure/mock_terraform_gen.py

# Some include their own CLI interfaces for testing
python prototypes/workflows/demo_modernization.py --simulate
```

### **Expected Behavior**
- **Hardcoded responses** for most inputs
- **Limited error handling** - may crash on edge cases
- **Mock data** instead of real API calls
- **Simplified interfaces** focused on core functionality

## 📖 **Understanding Prototype Code**

### **What to Pay Attention To:**
- **Interface design** - How users would interact with the feature
- **Data flow** - What inputs lead to what outputs
- **Integration points** - How it connects with existing system
- **Core algorithms** - The essential logic (usually simplified)

### **What to Ignore:**
- **Error handling** - Prototypes assume happy path
- **Performance** - Not optimized for speed or memory
- **Security** - No authentication, validation, or sanitization
- **Edge cases** - Only handles common scenarios

## 🤝 **Contributing to Prototypes**

### **When to Add Prototypes:**
- Exploring a new feature before roadmap inclusion
- Testing different approaches to a known problem
- Validating user experience for complex workflows
- Experimenting with new technologies or integrations

### **Prototype Guidelines:**
- **Include clear warning labels** in code comments
- **Document the concept being tested** in a README
- **Keep it simple** - focus on core concept validation
- **Don't over-engineer** - it's meant to be throwaway code

### **File Naming Conventions:**
- `mock_*.py` - Simulated implementations
- `demo_*.py` - User experience demonstrations
- `test_*.py` - Concept validation experiments
- `prototype_*.py` - Technical feasibility tests

*Remember: Prototypes are our way of learning and validating before we build. They're intentionally incomplete and experimental. When you see production-quality code, it lives in the `src/` directory.*
