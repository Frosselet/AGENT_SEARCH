## ⚠️ **Important Distinctions**

### **🟢 Production Code (`src/`)**
- **Fully implemented** and tested
- **Production ready** with error handling
- **Documented** with examples
- **Stable APIs** that won't break

### **🔵 Prototype Code (`prototypes/`)**
- **Experimental** implementations
- **Mock behaviors** to test concepts
- **Unstable interfaces** that change frequently
- **Educational** - shows how we think about problems

### **🟡 Roadmap Content (`docs/roadmap/`)**
- **Specifications** for future development
- **Research notes** and design decisions
- **Not implemented** yet
- **Subject to change** based on learning
